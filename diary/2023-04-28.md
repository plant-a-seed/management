### What has been done

* In person meeting with new members of the team
* Set up of Github organization
* Discussed important first-steps:
  - There is a pre-existant irrigation hardware but we don't know much about it
  - There is a solar panel powering and we have to analyse it to understand if it is enough
  - We will have to order hardware for the project, initially for a single bed
  - We need connectivity:
     * Eduroam could be used, but without exposing the credentials -> forwarder + "locker"
     * A sim with hotspot could be a good alternative, but maybe expensive
  - We do not have knowledge / skills about plants:
     * What are the requirements?
     * Which sensors / data should we collect?
     * How should we dispose the sensors in the beds?
  - We are not using a RaspberryPi anymore, too high level, microcontrollers could just directly use the WiFi
